		<h1>Go-EMD</h1>
		<h4>- Go Language: EMbarrassingly Distributed</h6>

		<!-- Description -->
		<p><b>Go-EMD</b> allows you to write projects that will take control of a cluster of machines perform tasks that are too big or too resource consuming for one machine to do.  This is written in GoLang so it is runnable on all machines that have GoLang installed.</p>

		<h3>What's GoLang (Go)?</h3>
		<p><a href="http://golang.org/" target="_blank">GoLang</a> is a programming language owned by Google built for great resource management and utilization of cores allowing for great concurrency programming. -- See more on the GoLang website to learn the language.</p>

		<h3>Why use Go-EMD?</h3>
		<p>If you have a problem set that is resource intensive or just a task that needs to be performed with many machines being synchronized with each other, then Go-EMD is a solution.  It provides a framework for building a distribution easily, a GUI to monitor and view the health of the ditribution, and provides a quick and easy way to perform agile development.</p>

		<h3>Where to start...</h3>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Download the latest release of <a href="https://github.com/go-emd/emd/releases" target="_blank">EMD</a>, <a href="https://github.com/go-emd/gui/releases" target="_blank">GUI</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/go-emd/boilerplate/releases" target="_blank">Boilerplate</a> from Github.</li>
				<li>Add Go-EMD to the GOPATH environment variable.</li>
				<li>Edit the Boilerplate config.json file to have the correct hostnames etc.</li>
				<li>Compile the Boilerplate distribution.</li>
				<li>Start the distribution by doing "go run Boilerplate/leaders/<hostname/ip>.go".</li>
				<li>Edit the GUI config.json to match handle the Boilerplate distribution.</li>
				<li>Open a browser to <hostname>:<config.json port> and view the distribution health.</li>
			</ol>
			That's it! Only seven steps and your up and running!
